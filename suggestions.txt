Other things you can do (that i won't be doing here):
- you can expand on this basic CRUD API and build a whole functional system

a simple one

probably overkill (since there's already software for that and this is just for practice anyway)

- you can use a ORM. eg. Sequelize
https://sequelize.org/

- you can use Docker
to run your whole app, or to run sqlite as a server

- you can manage the database schema as code. eg. Atlas
