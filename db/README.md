# Initilize the database
To initialize the db (create the db and tables), you have several options:

- run this sqlite3 command

    `sqlite3 school.db < initialize_db.sql`

    This creates a database file named "school". You can change that if you want.

- run a js script

    `node initialize_db.js`

- using an SQLite Client to issue commands


# View the data

the idea is the same, but here's a bash script for that:

`bash view_data.sh`
